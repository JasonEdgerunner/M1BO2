# M1BO2

So the first commit is basically me adding the html to this github. I don't know exactly how to pack the entire site in here, maybe filezilla hosting and just providing a link? That makes much more sense...

Commit 2, what did I add? A link to the site, which works!!

I wonder if it looks okay. Oh well, that's what I've made it live for
